# Into to Tuples
# Tuples are immutable
# no append,insert pop,remove

# data that never change 
# like days of the week years etc
# tuples are faster thn list

# methods allowed in tuples
# 1. count,
# 2.len 
# 3.slicing

t=1,2,3,4,5
for i in t:
    print(i,end=" ")
print(type(t))

# for single element

nums=(1,)
num=(1)
print(type(nums))
print(type(num))

# always return type of function is tuple
